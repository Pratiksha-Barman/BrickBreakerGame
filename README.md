# BrickBreakerGame
This Brick Breaker Game is a simple and fun game built using Python and Tkinter. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks using a ball while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen using a paddle.


# Game Features
1. Paddle Control: Move the paddle left or right using the arrow keys to keep the ball in play.
2. Ball Movement: The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks. If it touches the bottom of the screen, you lose the game.
3. Bricks: Break all the bricks to win the game. Each brick breaks when the ball hits it.
4. Win/Lose Messages: Displays "You Win!" when all bricks are broken and "You Lose!" when the ball touches the lower boundary.
